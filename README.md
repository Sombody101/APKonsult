# APKonsult

APKonsult is a Discord bot in my servers `APKognito`, a guild for [APKognito](https://github.com/Sombody101/APKognito) support, and `Bot Testing`, a guild for
updates and insider knowledge of how APKonsult works, but mainly for me to debug and test bot features.

I ***do not*** recommend you, or anyone else, use this bot because it has been made for a specific production environment and you will not have much luck getting it set up. 
I will not be providing any assistance with this bot as a result of that. I'm leaving it open source in case there's a random code snippet or class that can help 
with your bot or application.
If you need help otherwise, you're on your own.
